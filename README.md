>> I learned the difference between single thread and multithread. I found JS is single thread and how we can make it multi-thread with the help of event loop.
>> I learned about Asynchronus language. Js is synchronous and to make it Asynchronus, we need to use callbacks.
>> I learned the difference between ES5 vs ES6. I leanred how EcmaScript community avoid "break the web" principle - It can be done with the help of Transpiler (Bible).
>> I learned how to not write ambigous code. I leanred JS is dynamically type language.
>> I learned how Asynchronous work, and how the Asynchrounus tasks goes into the V8 engine and then to eventLoop.
>> I learned that everything in JS is object, even the Array too. To iterate the arrayys/object, we need to use Object CLASS .Keys or .enetries functions with the help of forEach or forOF loop.
>> I learned about the callback fucntions - that we can pass function in the function.

var is old way to assign and not suitable to use in current era
var can not stop us to recreate the variable with the name that is already created
var name = 'Ali';
var name = 'Ghazanfar';
console.log(name);

es6 provides let keyword that does stop us to reassign the same name
let firstName = 'Ali';
let firstName = "Ghazanfar"; {I got error}

const is used to assign the number for one time that cannot be changed
const val = 67;

Prmitive types are those that is builtin by JS like String, Boolean etc

if we assign undefined to a variable, the datatype of that var become undefined
but if we assign a variable null, it's type object
